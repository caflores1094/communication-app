# Communication App

## Building and running for development

Assumed to be using Node v12

From there:

```
$ npm install
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ cd ..
$ npm start
```

This will start a local development server running the application. Everything should work with Hot Reloading and includes the React and Redux Dev Tools, as well as Redux Logging in the console.  Note that these development features are disabled in production builds.
